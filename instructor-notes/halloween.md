# Notes

We tell the user when halloween trick or treating is when they enter the feature.

## The user on the day of trick or treating -

They can go house to house, enter the address, and rate the house based on the following criteria:

- Quality - how good was the haul at the house? (1-5, 1 would be you got an apple, five would be a bunch of good stuff)
- Quantity - how much stuff.

- Bonus points for:
    - Ambiance (good decorations, whatever)
    - Full Size (they gave you a full-sized snickers bar or whatever)

All of these  are sent to an API.

The user can review this information and 
- sort by quality, quantity, overall points, whatever.

- They can share this list with others in the same zip code.
